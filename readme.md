- **Name: Build-A-Burger**
- **Description: I am building a full CRUD application that will allow people to keep track of their favorite burgers.  This can be a burger you've made at home or one that you found at a restaurant.  The Index page will show a list of unique burgers names that the user can click on to get a more in depth description of that burger.  Once they click on said burger, the user will be taken to that burgers Show page giving a full description of the burger plus where it can be found.  User will be able to update/add ingredients, pictures, and location of where said burger can be found. There will also be an about section of the dev (me)**
